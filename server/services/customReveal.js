/**
 * WHEN A CUSTOM MARKET'S DECLARED RESULT BECOMES VISIBLE.
 *
 * The operator is allowed to declare a result long before the draw happens -
 * that is how the admin panel stays useful - but the PUBLIC page must never
 * show it early. Declaring at 09:00 for a market that opens at 09:15 must not
 * publish anything at 09:00.
 *
 * So the clock, not the declaration, decides what is visible:
 *
 *   upcoming  nothing at all, even if both halves are already stored
 *   live      the OPEN half only ("127-0") - it is being drawn right now,
 *             and the close half is still in the future
 *   closed    everything declared for that draw ("190-08-369")
 *
 * This mirrors how a provider market reveals itself in liveBoard.js, so a
 * custom market is indistinguishable from one the provider supplies.
 *
 * Provider markets are untouched: their result data is whatever the upstream
 * API returns, gated by its own logic in liveBoard.js.
